# ChatBot-OpenAI-ChatGPT
This is a project with NodeJs using the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that has chatgpt integrated.

I have used chatgpt 4.0.0, if you want to use this code you will have to request authorization from OpenAI, otherwise it will not work.

And remember that you need your own OpenAI api key, copy and paste it into the .env file.
